## Training Progression

The following visualization illustrates the model's predictions over several epochs during the training process compared to the ground truth:

![Training Progression](path/to/training_visualization.png)

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial Learning**:
   - At early epochs (e.g., Epoch 100), the model begins capturing broad structural features, though the finer details are missing.

2. **Steady Improvement**:
   - Between Epochs 300â€“500, predictions become more refined and aligned with the ground truth.

3. **Convergence**:
   - By Epoch 800, the model closely approximates the ground truth, especially in critical regions of interest (red rectangles).

### Implications:
These results indicate that the model successfully learns key features from the training data and demonstrates strong convergence, making it a reliable candidate for downstream tasks.

## Test Case Performance

The test cases evaluate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. Below is a comparison of the ground truth and model predictions at Epoch 800 for two test examples:

### Key Observations:
1. **Generalization**:
   - The model accurately reproduces the ground truth patterns in unseen examples, validating its robustness and generalization capabilities.

2. **Consistency Across Cases**:
   - The model consistently performs well in capturing both intricate details (Example 2) and broader structures (Example 3).

3. **Potential Improvements**:
   - Minor discrepancies in areas with subtle gradients or boundary complexities suggest opportunities for further refinement.

### Implications:
The accurate reproduction of ground truth patterns on test data confirms that the model is not overfitting and is well-suited for real-world deployment scenarios.
