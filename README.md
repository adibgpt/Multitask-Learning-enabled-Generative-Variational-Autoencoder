# Model Training and Evaluation

This repository contains the results of training and evaluating the Generative Variational Autoencoder enhanced by interpolation and SE policies. The visualizations provided showcase the model's progression during training and its performance on test cases.

## Training Progression

The following visualization illustrates the model's predictions over several epochs during the training process compared to the ground truth:

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial Learning**:
   - At early epochs (e.g., Epoch 100), the model begins capturing broad structural features, though the finer details are missing.

2. **Steady Improvement**:
   - Between Epochs 300â€“500, predictions become more refined and aligned with the ground truth.

3. **Convergence**:
   - By Epoch 800, the model closely approximates the ground truth, especially in critical regions of interest (red rectangles).

### Implications:
These results indicate that the model successfully learns key features from the training data and demonstrates strong convergence, making it a reliable candidate for downstream tasks.

## Test Case Performance

The test cases evaluate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. Below is a comparison of the ground truth and model predictions at Epoch 800 for two test examples:

### Key Observations:
1. **Generalization**:
   - The model accurately reproduces the ground truth patterns in unseen examples, validating its robustness and generalization capabilities.

2. **Consistency Across Cases**:
   - The model consistently performs well in capturing both intricate details (Example 2) and broader structures (Example 3).

3. **Potential Improvements**:
   - Minor discrepancies in areas with subtle gradients or boundary complexities suggest opportunities for further refinement.

### Implications:
The accurate reproduction of ground truth patterns on test data confirms that the model is not overfitting and is well-suited for real-world deployment scenarios.
